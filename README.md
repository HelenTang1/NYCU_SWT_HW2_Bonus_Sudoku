# Sudoku Solver - TDD Implementation

## Overview
This project implements a Sudoku solver using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles. The implementation follows a systematic approach where tests are written before the actual code, ensuring robust and reliable functionality.

## Project Description
Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that:
- Each column contains all digits from 1 to 9
- Each row contains all digits from 1 to 9
- Each of the nine 3×3 subgrids contains all digits from 1 to 9

## Development Approach

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
This project follows the TDD methodology:
1. **Red Phase**: Write a failing test that defines a desired improvement or new function
2. **Green Phase**: Write the minimal code necessary to pass the test
3. **Refactor Phase**: Clean up the code while ensuring all tests still pass


## Features

- Sudoku puzzle solving algorithm
- Check for valid Sudoku solutions
- Support for partially filled Sudoku grids
- Comprehensive test suite

## Requirements
